### Description

MonieJar is a personal finance tracking application where the user can create an account and enter their budget goals and expenses, which are displayed as cards and lists. Users are then able to edit or delete these budgets or expenses to their desire. This repository is specifically the front end of the project. The front end is built with a react template from MUI and deployed using AWS Amplify. The backend was built with JavaScript, Node.Js, SQL and deployed using Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, Aurora and RDS, and Route53, all from the AWS Console.

#### Some features include:

📝 User Registration/Account Creation - Using email and a password of at least 6 characters.<br/>
🚫 Error Handling - User is prompted when logging in with wrong login credintials.<br/>
⌨️ Reset Password - User is able to receive a reset password email when they forget their password.<br/>
🚪 Automatic Logout - When the broswer is open for an hour, the user is automatically logged out for security.<br/>
💰 Budget Goals - Users can enter budget goals, indicating a timeline for each goal and a date for when the budget was first entered. Users can edit and delete these goals.<br/>
🛍️ Expenses - Users can enter a expense including details such as item name, location purchased, amount, and date purchased. Users can edit and delete these expenses.<br/>

### Motivation

The first project I built was also a personal finance tracking application, which only included data entry for budgets, expenses, income, and savings goals. You can visit that project <a href="https://chelseajcaines.github.io/MyFunds/">here</a>. For this project I wanted to revisit the idea and give it a backend. The backend includes user authentication, data storage and organization in a database, and testing.
